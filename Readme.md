## AetherChain: A Modern Blockchain Built in Rust

AetherChain is a lightweight, performant, and secure blockchain built from the ground up in Rust, focusing
on providing a robust platform for decentralized applications. The project leverages Rust's safety and
concurrency features to create a reliable and efficient network.

Note that this project is built for learning purposes only.

### Core Features:

- Peer-to-Peer Networking: Implements a custom P2P layer for seamless and decentralized communication between
  nodes.
- Consensus Protocol: Features a consensus mechanism to ensure the integrity and immutability of the
  distributed ledger.
- Modular Architecture: Designed with a clean and modular structure to encourage community contributions and
  extensions.
- Performance & Safety: Built with Rust to guarantee memory safety and deliver high-performance transaction
  processing.

This repository contains the full implementation of the AetherChain node, including networking, consensus,
and blockchain logic. We are passionate about building a truly decentralized future and welcome contributors
of all levels to join us on this journey.
